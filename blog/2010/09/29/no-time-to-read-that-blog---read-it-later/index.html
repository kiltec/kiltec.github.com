In order to keep up-to-date with what's going on in the tech world, I read a lot of blogs, visit <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> regularly etc. during my lunch break for example.
</p>
<p>
Frequently, I will stumble upon seemingly interesting articles but either they're too long to be read during the break or there's no time left to read them.<br />
What I used to do until a year ago was to move those articles into a bookmark folder called 'toread', in order to remember to read it when I would have more time. But it was always a bit of a hassle, so I was never really satisfied with that solution.<br />
</p>
<p>
Then I discovered <a href="http://readitlaterlist.com/">Read It Later</a>.</p>
<p>
It's a Firefox Addon that with the click on a button or hitting a keyboard shortcut will save the page you're currently viewing into a list for later access.<br />
When you have time, you can check out said list and with one click or shortcut, you remove the page from the list and <a href="http://readitlaterlist.com/">Read It Later</a> will get you to the next page you've saved in chronological order.<br />
Not only that, it also integrates with Google Reader, allowing you to directly save articles without having to leave it.<br />
Additionally, if you use several computers, you can optionally save the list remotely, so you can access the same list from different computers.<br />
And there are <a href="http://readitlaterlist.com/firefox/">many more features</a>, for example an API you can use to code your own app.
</p>
<p>
The way I use it is that I'll put articles into it until I hit the threshold of 100 saved items and when I have time, e.g. during the weekend, I'll go through those items and read them - or rather, not read them.<br />
That's the beauty about this, often it will turn out that the article or blog I'm getting to isn't that interesting after all and I can quickly move to the next article in the list.<br />
And that decision is really based on my thinking it isn't interesting and not by feeling under pressure due to lack of time.
</p>
<p>
This is absolutely one of those Firefox addons I don't want to live without anymore.
