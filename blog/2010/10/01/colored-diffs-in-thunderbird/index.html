At work we do code review by getting emails with the diff of every commit to our SVN repository. One day I wondered whether there was an addon for Thunderbird to get colored diffs - and sure enough, there was:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/colorediffs/">colorediffs by Vadim Atlygin</a> 
</p>
<p>
It features various display modes, e.g. simple coloring of unified diffs:
</p>

<p>
Or side-by-side diffs:
</p>
<img src="http://www.lars-tesmer.com/images/side-by-side.png" /> <br />
<p>
As you can see it will also display whitespace characters, if you want to.<br />
Moreover, you can set the tab width to your preferred value.<br />
You can find more screenshots <a href="http://code.google.com/p/colorediffs/wiki/Screenshots">in the wiki of colorediffs.</a>
</p>
<p>
Yet again, another useful Thunderbird-addon making my life a little bit easier.
